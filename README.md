in this project, I used Python and unsepervised learning (scikit-learn) to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

I prepared the data by scaling data using StandardScaler, found the optimal k-vlaue and then clustered the cryptocurriences with K-Means.

As a comparison, I then optimized the clusters using principal componenet analysis, found the optimal k-vlaue and then clustered the cryptocurriences with K-Means.
